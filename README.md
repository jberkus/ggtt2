Give A Great Tech Talk 2
========================

This repository is for all of the tutorial files for Josh Berkus's
public speaking tutorial, "Give a Great Tech Talk", given at various
Linux Foundation events.  This tutorial is based on the original
"Give a Great Tech Talk" developed by Ian Dees and Josh Berkus, 
originally given at Open Source Bridge, which is no longer available
on GitHub.  Hence the "2".
